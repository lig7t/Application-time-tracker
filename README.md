To replicate Steam's Play time feature, using python I have made this app. 
Currently, I have used tkinter to add some basic GUI to the app but I am planning to make the UI look better and clean up the code, and make an executable eventually.

INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------
* The '.json' files must exist in the same directory (will remove this step in the future).
* The application must be added using it's path ("..\..\[app_name].exe" -> remove the "\[app_name].exe" from the path).

P.S- There may be some issues as of 12/13/24, however, they will soon be fixed.
